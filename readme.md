# Laravel Blog

This is a repository for my Laravel Blog project at Codeup.

## Getting Started

- Clone the repository
- Create a database for this application
- Remove the local database.php file
    - `$ rm app/config/local/database.php`
- setup the app db config to use environment variables for the db host, database, username, and password
- copy `/env-template.php`
- fill in the empty strings with your credentials
- save as `.env.local.php`
